# ğŸ’³ Install Stripe Dependencies

Run this in your frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

This adds:
- `@stripe/stripe-js` - Core Stripe library
- `@stripe/react-stripe-js` - React components for Stripe

After installing, we'll add the payment step to the booking flow!
